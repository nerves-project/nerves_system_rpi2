## Using

The most common way of using this Nerves System is create a project with `mix
nerves.new` and to export `MIX_TARGET=rpi2`. See the [Getting started
guide](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/getting-started.html#creating-a-new-nerves-app)
for more information.

If you need custom modifications to this system for your device, clone this
repository and update as described in [Making custom
systems](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/customizing-systems.html).

## Upgrading to 2.0

If your application depended on a pre-2.0 version of this Nerves system and you
are upgrading, you'll need to start validating firmware after it boots the first
time. If you don't do this, the Nerves MOTD will show that the firmware hasn't
been validated when you log in. You can manually validate by calling
`Nerves.Runtime.validate_firmware/0` or running the `fw_validate` helper at the IEx prompt.
If you don't do this, the device will run the old firmware on the next reboot.

A simple default way of validating the firmware can be enabled using
Nerves.Runtime's startup guard feature as described in [Assisted firmware
validation and automatic
revert](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves_runtime/readme.html#assisted-firmware-validation-and-automatic-revert).
Please follow the directions there for the needed config file update.

If in doubt, use `mix nerves.new` to create a new project and compare what it
creates to your project. If you haven't modified the Nerves-specific
configuration parts of your project much, the firmware validation piece should
be the main update.

Please also review your use of `Nerves.Runtime.KV` in your application since the
`nerves_fw_active` key no longer is used. Use `Nerves.Runtime.firmware_slots/0`
to determine the active firmware slot. The `nerves_fw_active` key wasn't always
accurate, so it was removed to avoid a misleading answer. The function call is
reliable and also a generic way to determine slot status on all Nerves
platforms.

## Supported USB WiFi devices

The base image includes drivers and firmware for Ralink RT53xx
(`rt2800usb` driver), RealTek RTL8712U (`r8712u` driver) and
RealTek RTL 8192 (`rtl8192cu` driver) devices (e.g. Edimax USB WiFi dongles).

We are still working out which subset of all possible WiFi dongles to
support in our images. At some point, we may have the option to support
all dongles and selectively install modules at packaging time, but until
then, these drivers and their associated firmware blobs add significantly
to Nerves release images.

If you are unsure what driver your WiFi dongle requires, run Raspbian and
configure WiFi for your device. At a shell prompt, run `lsmod` to see which
drivers are loaded.  Running `dmesg` may also give a clue. When using `dmesg`,
reinsert the USB dongle to generate new log messages if you don't see them.

## Audio

The Raspberry Pi has many options for audio output. This system supports the
HDMI and stereo audio jack output. The Linux ALSA drivers are used for audio
output.

The general Raspberry Pi audio documentation mostly applies to Nerves. For
example, to force audio out the HDMI port, run:

```elixir
cmd("amixer cset numid=3 2")
```

Change the last argument to `amixer` to `1` to output to the stereo output jack.

## Provisioning devices

This system supports storing provisioning information in a small key-value store
outside of any filesystem. Provisioning is an optional step and reasonable
defaults are provided if this is missing.

Provisioning information can be queried using the Nerves.Runtime KV store's
[`Nerves.Runtime.KV.get/1`](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves_runtime/Nerves.Runtime.KV.html#get/1)
function.

Keys used by this system are:

Key                    | Example Value     | Description
:--------------------- | :---------------- | :----------
`nerves_serial_number` | `"12345678"`      | By default, this string is used to create unique hostnames and Erlang node names. If unset, it defaults to part of the Raspberry Pi's device ID.

The normal procedure would be to set these keys once in manufacturing or before
deployment and then leave them alone.

For example, to provision a serial number on a running device, run the following
and reboot:

```elixir
iex> cmd("fw_setenv nerves_serial_number 12345678")
```

This system supports setting the serial number offline. To do this, set the
`NERVES_SERIAL_NUMBER` environment variable when burning the firmware. If you're
programming MicroSD cards using `fwup`, the commandline is:

```sh
sudo NERVES_SERIAL_NUMBER=12345678 fwup path_to_firmware.fw
```

Serial numbers are stored on the MicroSD card so if the MicroSD card is
replaced, the serial number will need to be reprogrammed. The numbers are stored
in a U-boot environment block. This is a special region that is separate from
the application partition so reformatting the application partition will not
lose the serial number or any other data stored in this block.

Additional key value pairs can be provisioned by overriding the default
provisioning.conf file location by setting the environment variable
`NERVES_PROVISIONING=/path/to/provisioning.conf`. The default provisioning.conf
will set the `nerves_serial_number`, if you override the location to this file,
you will be responsible for setting this yourself.

## Linux kernel and RPi firmware/userland

There's a subtle coupling between the `nerves_system_br` version and the Linux
kernel version used here. `nerves_system_br` provides the versions of
`rpi-userland` and `rpi-firmware` that get installed. I prefer to match them to
the Linux kernel to avoid any issues. Unfortunately, none of these are tagged by
the Raspberry Pi Foundation so I either attempt to match what's in Raspbian or
take versions of the repositories that have similar commit times.
